# Frontend Mentor - 3-column preview card component
This project is for the Frontend Mentor Challenge. 

## The Approach

Initially, i used Bootstrap 5 since the layout is CLEARLY a column template, however it gets to messy and i endded 
overcomplicates it. 

The problem worsens in which I have deployed ontoGithub pages and the Bootstrap styling did not apply, and instead only uses CSS styling. 

## The Remedy 
After reviewing other users code, most uses vanilla css and it seems easier, so i use Vanilla instead,

## Takeaway

Need to work on my Bootstrap and CSS skill
